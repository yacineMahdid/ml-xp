I am following this tutorial: [link](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html?highlight=style%20transfer)
which is implementing: [arxiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)

# What I understood
We have two distance: one for content another for style, we measure the difference between the content and style image for the input image. Then we modify it in order to minimize this distance.

# to get started
Download anaconda: [Conda Installation](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
Download pytorch using anaconda: [Pytorch Installation](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
